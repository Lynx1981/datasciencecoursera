The data contained in tidy data set output by the run_analysis.R is named in the following way:
first two columns named Subject and Activity represent the subject and the activity for which the set of records was summarized. 
The rest of the columns are preceeded by Average_ label and represent the average values of variables listed in feature.txt and quoted below. The only variables present are mean and standard deviation values. 
<br/>
<br/>Here I provide the excirpt from original readme.txt describing the naming conventions, units of measure and meaning of the relevant variables:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ<br/>
tGravityAcc-XYZ<br/>
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ<br/>
tBodyGyro-XYZ<br/>
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ<br/>
tBodyAccMag<br/>
tGravityAccMag<br/>
tBodyAccJerkMag<br/>
tBodyGyroMag<br/>
tBodyGyroJerkMag<br/>
fBodyAcc-XYZ<br/>
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ<br/>
fBodyGyro-XYZ<br/>
fBodyAccMag<br/>
fBodyAccJerkMag<br/>
fBodyGyroMag<br/>
fBodyGyroJerkMag<br/>

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value<br/>
std(): Standard deviation
